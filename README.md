# StateMachines

## Overview

This project focuses on the design, simulation, and implementation of state machines using various flip-flops and counters. The main objectives were to design a debounced switch circuit, implement 2-bit and 3-bit counters, and explore different flip-flop configurations such as T-FF and JK-FF. The project was carried out using Quartus and the DE10-Lite FPGA board.

## Project Details

#### Debounced Switch Circuit

1. **Schematic Design:**
   - Designed a debounced switch circuit using a SPDT switch and NAND/NOR gates.
   - Tested the circuit using the Digilent Analog Discovery (DAD) tool to observe switch bouncing.
   
2. **Circuit Testing:**
   - Verified the debounced circuit using an oscilloscope and documented the results with screenshots.
   - Analyzed the impact of using a debounced switch on counter reliability.

#### Two-Bit Counter Design

1. **Next-State Truth Table:**
   - Created a truth table for the 2-bit counter to count in the sequence 00, 10, 11, 01, 00, â€¦
   
2. **K-Maps and SOP Equations:**
   - Derived SOP equations for the counter's next state using K-Maps.
   
3. **Counter Circuit Design:**
   - Implemented the 2-bit counter in Quartus with D flip-flops.
   - Added a Start input for asynchronous initialization.

4. **Simulation:**
   - Simulated the 2-bit counter and verified the sequence using a debounced clock input.
   - Compared the performance of the counter with debounced and undebounced clock inputs.

### Three-Bit Counter Design

1. **Next-State Truth Table:**
   - Developed a truth table for the 3-bit counter with inputs F (forward) and B (backward).

2. **K-Maps and SOP Equations:**
   - Determined the equations for the counter's next state and output Sp using K-Maps.

3. **Circuit Design and Simulation:**
   - Designed the 3-bit counter circuit in Quartus and simulated the forward and backward counting sequences.
   - Verified the functionality of the SET and CLR inputs and analyzed the behavior of the counter with different input combinations.

### Two-Bit Counter with Alternate Flip-Flops

1. **Design with T and JK Flip-Flops:**
   - Redesigned the 2-bit counter using a T flip-flop for the most significant bit and a JK flip-flop for the least significant bit.
   - Derived the next-state equations for the T, J, and K inputs.

2. **Simulation:**
   - Simulated the new 2-bit counter design and verified that it counts correctly.
